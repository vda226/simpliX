#####Howto:

Just copy the "simpliX" folders to the theme dirs. (eg: $HOME/.themes/simpliX/gtk-2.0)

#####Theme dirs:

* GTK2 **`$HOME/.themes`** or **`$SYSPREFIX/themes`** 
* GTK3 **`$HOME/.themes`** or **`$SYSPREFIX/themes`** 

#####Note:

* *the GTK2 theme was made for Xfce it may or may not work with other desktops*
* *the GTK2 theme depends on the pixbuf and mist gtk-engine*
* *the GTK3 theme may or may not work, srsly I don't care anymore :P*
* *there is a settings.ini in each GTK theme dir for a few options*
