ABOUT:

Kvantum (by Pedram Pourang, aka. Tsu Jan <tsujan2000@gmail.com>) is an SVG-based theme engine for Qt4 and KDE4.

Kvantum is a fork of QuantumStyle. The author of QuantumStyle, Saïd LANKRI, continued his work as QSvgSyle (https://github.com/DexterMagnific/QSvgStyle>) but, apparently, he and I went in different directions; hence the forking. I made lots of fixes, changes and additions and also reduced the memory footprint as far as possible. Credits go to Saïd Lankri for the idea and all the work he did for its first implementation.

Kvantum has a default dark theme, which should be used alongside the KDE/Qt4 color scheme included in the source and is inspired by the default theme of Enlightenment. Creation of such a theme for KDE was my main reason to make Kvantum but you could make your own themes for it with Inkscape; Kvantum will let you control almost every aspect of Qt widgets.

Please see INSTALL for instructions on compilation and installation!

For instructions on how to change configuration or make new themes, read the files Theme-Config and Theme-Making in the "doc" folder!
